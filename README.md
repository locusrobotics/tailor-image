# tailor-image

Just a quick script to generate a docker image for package test pipines to use.

Long term all sorts of images...

- Docker
- LXD
- Bare metal

 ...should be generated here using something like Packer, for purposes of:

 - machine installation
 - developer use
 - automated test environments
